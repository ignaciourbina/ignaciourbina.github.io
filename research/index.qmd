## What Are Research Briefs?

Research briefs are short, accessible summaries of academic research designed for broader audiences. Unlike full academic papers, briefs:

- **Focus on insights** rather than exhaustive literature review
- **Use visualization** to communicate findings
- **Include interactivity** so readers can explore data
- **Provide context** without requiring specialized knowledge

### Example Structure

Each brief follows a consistent format:

1. **TL;DR** — One-paragraph summary
2. **Key Findings** — 3-5 main takeaways with supporting visuals
3. **Background** — Why this question matters
4. **Methods** — Collapsible section with technical details
5. **Implications** — What this means for practice/policy
6. **Resources** — Links to paper, code, data
