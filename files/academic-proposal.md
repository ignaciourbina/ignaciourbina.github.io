I am a political economist studying how democracies can govern artificial intelligence. My research combines experimental methods with computational modeling to understand how citizens form preferences about emerging technologies and what this means for democratic governance. My training spans political science, economics, and public policy, and my prior experience as an Economic Analyst at the Chilean Ministry of Finance grounds my work in the realities of policy implementation.

## Core Research Finding

Most accounts of automation politics assume economic self-interest drives policy preferences: workers whose jobs are threatened should demand government protection. **My dissertation shows this model is incomplete.**

In a pre-registered experiment with approximately 1,000 U.S. workers, I find that information about automation risk changes policy preferences—but only conditionally:

- **Demand for protective government policy is strongest** among workers who trust expert sources, learn that their risk is higher than they expected, and possess high trait anxiety.
- **Workers who distrust experts show no response** regardless of their risk level.
- **Those who trust experts but receive confirming information show weak effects.**

This matters for policy: effective risk communication requires credible sources reaching psychologically receptive audiences.

## Research Agenda

### Near Term (Years 1–2)

My immediate priorities are publishing my dissertation work in top academic venues and launching Chile-focused research.

**Job Market Paper:** "The Conditional Activation Model: Uncovering Policy Demand Responses to AI-Driven Automation" formalizes and tests the conditional structure described above.

**Extensions:**
- Replicate in Chile, testing whether the two-gate structure holds in a context with different baseline levels of expert trust
- Experimentally manipulate source credibility—varying whether automation risk information comes from academic experts, government agencies, or industry sources

**Additional Dissertation Chapters:**
- Co-authored with Oleg Smirnov: Uses exploratory factor analysis to map the structure of AI attitudes in the mass public—identifying distinct dimensions of concern that current policy debates conflate
- Agent-based model of AI-augmented democratic deliberation, examining conditions under which algorithmic mediation improves or degrades collective decision-making

**Chile-Specific Work:**
- Replicate automation-policy experiments using nationally representative samples and Chilean labor market data
- Develop and validate Spanish-language instruments for measuring AI attitudes, enabling comparative research across Latin America

### Medium Term (Years 3–5)

**Expanding Experimental Work on Human-AI Cooperation:**
A working paper with Reuben Kline and Akhil Ponda—presented at APSA, Oxford's "Talking to Machines" workshop, and IMEBESS—examines how communication with AI agents affects cooperation in social dilemmas. This research investigates how AI-mediated interaction shapes trust and collective action, with applications to designing systems that facilitate rather than displace human coordination.

**Applied Research on AI-Augmented Deliberation:**
- Partner with Chilean municipalities to pilot AI-augmented citizen consultations
- Leverage Chile's experience with participatory budgeting and constitutional deliberation
- Design AI systems that enhance citizen participation (summarizing public input, identifying areas of consensus, surfacing minority viewpoints) rather than replacing human judgment

### Long-Term Vision

By year five, aim to secure seed funding for a research cluster on AI and democratic governance, potentially a nucleus for a future Instituto Milenio.

**Natural Partners:**
- CENIA (technical AI research)
- School of Engineering's AI researchers
- Law School's regulation scholars

**First Milestone:** A 2030 workshop bringing together Latin American researchers working at this intersection.

## Teaching Offerings

### Experimental Methods for Policy Research
*(Graduate or advanced undergraduate)*

Cover survey experiments, field experiments, and causal inference for policy evaluation. Students would:
- Replicate published studies
- Debug code
- Confront messy data
- Experience the gap between methods sections and actual research
- Design original experiments relevant to Chilean policy questions

### AI, Technology, and Public Policy

Examine:
- Automation and labor markets
- Regulatory models across jurisdictions
- Public opinion toward emerging technologies
- Algorithmic accountability in government decisions

Combines technical literacy with governance frameworks, accessible to social science students without programming backgrounds. Course content draws directly from dissertation and working papers, incorporating Chilean and Latin American cases.

### Other Offerings

- **Behavioral Economics for Public Policy** (previously taught at Finis Terrae University, 2018–2020)
- Thesis supervision on technology policy, AI governance, and political behavior

## Methodological Commitments

Throughout all research:
- Pre-registered experiments
- Causal identification
- Transparency
